# `postgrest-js`


Isomorphic JavaScript client for [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org). The goal of this library is to make an "ORM-like" restful interface.

Full documentation can be found [here](https://deezbase.github.io/postgrest-js/v2).

### Quick start

Install

```bash
npm install @deezbase/postgrest-js
```

Usage

```js
import { PostgrestClient } from '@deezbase/postgrest-js'

const REST_URL = 'http://localhost:3000'
const postgrest = new PostgrestClient(REST_URL)
```

- insert(): https://deezbase.com/docs/reference/javascript/insert
- update(): https://deezbase.com/docs/reference/javascript/update
- delete(): https://deezbase.com/docs/reference/javascript/delete

#### Custom `fetch` implementation

`postgrest-js` uses the [`cross-fetch`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-fetch) library to make HTTP requests, but an alternative `fetch` implementation can be provided as an option. This is most useful in environments where `cross-fetch` is not compatible, for instance Cloudflare Workers:

```js
import { PostgrestClient } from '@deezbase/postgrest-js'

const REST_URL = 'http://localhost:3000'
const postgrest = new PostgrestClient(REST_URL, {
    fetch: (...args) => fetch(...args),
})
```
